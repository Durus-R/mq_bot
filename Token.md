# How to create a token
- Go to <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications">https://discord.com/developers/applications
- Create a new application here or go to an existing one
- Go to "Bot" and click on "Create Bot" (if you haven't created one yet)
- Go to "Token" and click on "Reveal Token", or create a new token.
- If the bot has not been used for a long time, you need to create a new token.
- Copy the token and paste it into a new file named "Token.txt".

Of course you can also use an existing token.

Copy the token and paste it into a new file named "Token.txt".

The file must be in the same directory as this file.
